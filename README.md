What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)? 

- What are the correlations between a country's GDP and their happiness index (HI)? If there isn't a clear correlation between GDP and HI, what other correlations can be observed? We can answer this question by filtering the country's with the highest GDPs and see if there are any trends in terms of happiness index and vise-versa.

- Are there regions of the world that are happier than others? We can plot the happiness data on a ggmap to see if there are any regions that are markedly happier than others. 

- How does freedom and health affect how HI a country is? By using the freedom and health markers we can see if countries with high levels of freedom and health are happier. 

- Does weather and/or landscape have an affect on a country's HI? Again, using a ggmap we can plot the data and figure out if colder/hotter regions of the world tend to be happier.
